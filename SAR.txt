Notes for Scholars at risk:
  international network of institutions and individuals
  mission is to protect scholars and promote academic freedom
 
 Scholars are scholars that are threatened for their work
  assassination attempts
  prosecution
  travel restrictions
  govt and non-govt
  
What they do:
  protection:
    assist at-risk scholars by connecting them w academic oppportunities
  advocacy:
    monitor and report attacks on education
  learning:
    bring ppl together to understand what academic freedom is

Scale is huge:
  >500 institutions
  >5,000 requests
  >700 caseloads
  only tip of iceberg

Challenge:
  most people seeing these attacks "self-censor"
    self-censoring is when you don't say stuff because you know you'll get persecuted for it
  when you see others getting persecuted, why would YOU do the same?
  self-censorship warps knowledge
  scope of self-censorship is MASSIVE
    but if we can expose the scope of self-censorship, we can combat it
      the issue is that it's rly hard and requires a lot of resources

Statment:
  Help us develop a digital vehicle that'll help get a better idea of what self-censorhip is, how it manifests, and who it affects
  Security challenges:
    ppl are scared to report for fear of being found out.
    how to protect data so it doesn't get into bad hands
  generate a large response rate:
    incentivize?
  must be FREE for users/reporters, and cheap for SAR
  multilingual interface/data capture
  simple, attractive visualization of data for non-tech people
