Scholars at Risk:

International network of institutions and individuals whose mission it is to protect scholars and promote academic freedom

SAR scholars: academics in different fields across the world (mostly middle eastern, central/east/southeast asian, sub-saharan Africa)

Work with universities & networks
Place at risk scholars in positions where they can research, continue to do work, teach, try to raise awareness, etc

Helping hundreds of scholars, hard to keep track of incoming scholars, etc
Investigate allegations of attacks, 

The project: Combat self-censorship
- Known attacks are only a fraction of all those intimidated or silenced
- Rational actors witnessing theses attacks will “self-censor”, become bystanders
- Self-censorship warps knowledge, limits people, and is hard to prove

Challenges and needs:
- Security of users/eporteres
- Security and reliability of data
- Generate a large response rate across countries (incl. low bandwidth)
- Must be no cost for users/reports, low cost for SAR to maintain
- Automated multilingual interface/data capture would be ideal
- Simple, attractive visualization of data results would increase impact (useful for non-engineers -> make infographics)
- Drive donations
